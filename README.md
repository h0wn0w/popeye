This is a collection of curses, swear words, cuss words; however you refer to them is your choice. Cloning and using this repo is your choice as well. I accept no responsibility for your choices and/or actions. 

The reality is thus: swearing gets a bad rap, but it is an inextricable part of our daily, cultural vocabulary. It has some [merits][m] in terms of efficient communication, and might be a proxy or an indicator of an individual's [cognitive capacity][cc]. Though the research is decidedly sparse, [one study][one] revealed preliminary data that swearing could even help distinguish between a Frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's (Ringman, Kwon, Flores, Rotko, Mendez & Lu, 2010). Wow! Who knew?

There's not much to say as far as usage goes:

1. Pull this into TextExpander
2. Use. Importantly, accidental use is somewhat subverted since I prepended all snippets with "!". Unless you're using [Duck Duck Go bang syntax][bang], you're unlikely to accidentally trigger any of these. 

Well, what's the holdup? Clone this f*$%ing repo, already!
